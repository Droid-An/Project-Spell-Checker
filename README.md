# Project: Spell Checker

When writing text, it is helpful to have a tool to check that you are spelling correctly. Most computers even have it built in to the operating system.

This spell checker ckecks for a simplified language called ["Basic English"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English) that contains a much smaller set of words than regular English.

Just write some text and then check if the text is valid Basic English.
